# lagrange_simulator

Python script which simulates behavior of a satellite influenced by the gravity of the Earth and sun. Primary purpose is to demonstrate the Lagrange points, and especially their stability/instability.

This was hacked together in an hour and likely has issues. I'm very open to suggestions for improvement, or PRs :)
