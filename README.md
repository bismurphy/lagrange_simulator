# lagrange_simulator

Python script which simulates behavior of a satellite influenced by the gravity of the Earth and sun. Primary purpose is to demonstrate the Lagrange points, and especially their stability/instability.

This was hacked together in an hour and likely has issues. I'm very open to suggestions for improvement, or PRs :)

Any questions, also let me know - I'm leaving this undocumented for now because I don't expect anyone to actually be interested, but if you are interested, then I'm more than happy to give a usage guide or whatever else would be helpful.
